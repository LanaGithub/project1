Curriculum Vitae </i>
<br> by Samuel Menashe </br>

    </b>
</h3>

<p>
<br> Scribe out of work
<br> At a loss for words
<br> Not his to begin with,
<br> The man life passed by
<br> Stands at the window
<br> Biding his time
</br>

<br> Time and again
<br> And now once more
<br> I climb these stairs
<br> <em>Unlock this doorâ€”</em>
<br> No name where I live
<br> Alone in my lair
<br> <strong> one bone to pick</strong>
<br> And no time to spare
</p>
